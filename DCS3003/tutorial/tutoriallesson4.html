<p>
A <i><big><strong> shepherd </i></big></strong>boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near th eforest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>

<br>

<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <big><strong><i> The boy played a similar trick repeatdly for many days.</i></big></strong>
</p>

<br>

<p>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike> The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike>
</p>

<font color=#A699D5>
<big>The farmers</big> <sup> thought</sup><big> the boy was playing</big> <sub> mischief</sub> <big> again.</big></font> 
So, no one paid attention to him and didn't come to his help.
